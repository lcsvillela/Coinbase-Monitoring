# IDEA
It scrapes up latest blog posts from https://blog.coinbase.com/latest and rings an alarm whenever they post any update.<br/>
Made this for a Trader Chigga on Discord.<br/>
I've used requests and bs4(beautiful soup) for the main scraping and playsound library to ring the alarm.<br/>

# INSTALLATION
```
pip install requeriments.txt
```

the original code is [Coinbase-Blog-Scrapper], but is not working.
